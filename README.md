# IoT-Based-Waste-Managment-System
A smarter way to monitor bin levels and optimize pickups to reduce unsightly pileups for a cleaner future!

Many countries, developing and developed alike, struggle with efficient garbage collection that benefits both residents and waste management companies. The traditional method of scheduling a fixed day of the week to collect waste is outdated, as residents and businesses cannot always commit to having their garbage pile up on that day due to several reasons which will be outlined in this paper. They often resort to dumping their waste into other bins not assigned to them which leads to unsightly overflowing of garbage bins all around the cities. This project offers a prototype for an IoT-based smart garbage collection system that takes readings from ultrasonic sensors placed in the bin lids and dynamically decides the varying days and time of the week when collection should proceed, depending on the fullness of bins in a particular region enroute of each collection truck. All readings from bins in our prototype will be sent to an online user interface to be read and analyzed via Wi-Fi modules.

The following codes are presented in this repository:

  1.Sender Wifi Modules Arduino Codes
  
  2.Reciever Wifi Module Arduino Code
  
  3.Python Code to send sensor readings to user interface HTML page


A paper outlining our readings and findings is also shown.
